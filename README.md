                                                   Conversation-AI-Chatbot

A chatbot is a software or computer program that simulates human conversation or "chatter" through text or voice interactions.
Chatbot are used by almost every tech based company and become trending these days

There are some famous framework like RASA, Google's DialogFlow which provide Built-in function to design chatbot 
while designing on them designer have to manually type all query as well as their answers and today's world the data is of millions of size ,so it is feasible to mannually type all querys 


Here's Natural Language processing play a important role
i have created chatbot using Encoder and decoder model from scratch without using any library or framework  which is design to handle sequential problem

Here i have used word-level Embedding instead of character level embedding as it take more time to compute and faces overfitting

After successfully created project i have deploy this model using Flask Framework and host it on live server(ngrok)
